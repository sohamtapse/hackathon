      "[Document(metadata={'source': 'context.txt'}, page_content='Top 50 Data Structures Interview Questions And Answers PDF Data Structure Interview Questions for Freshers 1. What is a data structure? A \\ndata structure is a mechanical way to organise, align, and manipulate data as per requirements. It is not restricted to putting data in a table but \\ndeals with different datasets and how well they are aligned. The aim is to ensure that data can be organised and accessed efficiently. Data \\norganisation determines how a program performs. Moreover, data dependency and relationships between two or more datasets play a crucial \\nrole in data structures. While designing code, we need to pay utmost attention to how data is structured because incorrectly structured or \\ninefficiently stored data can hamper the overall performance of the code. 2. What are the applications of data structures? Data structures are \\napplied across multiple industries and domains as algorithms are the primary requirements in every business. Here are the major applications \\nof data structures: \\x00 Numerical and statistical analysis \\x00\\x00 Compiler design \\x00 Artificial intelligence \\x00 Database management \\x00 Graphical processing \\x00 Lexical analysis \\x00 Blockchain \\x00 Decision making \\x00 \\nOperating system design \\x00 Simulation 3. Describe the types of data structures. Data structures are divided into two categories: \\x00 Linear data \\nstructure \\x00 Non-linear data structure Linear Data Structure It includes data elements that are arranged sequentially or linearly. Also, each \\nelement is connected to its previous or next adjacent element. Types of linear data structure \\x00 \\x00 Static Data Structure: It has a fixed memory \\nsize, and it’s easier to access data elements. An example includes Array. Dynamic Data Structure: Size is not fixed and can be updated \\nrandomly. Examples include Queue and Stack. Common linear data structures \\x00 Array Data Structure: All the elements or values are of the same \\ntype. \\x00 Stack Data Structure: It follows LIFO (Last in, first out) order to perform operations, so the last element to be stored will be the first to be \\nretrieved. \\x00 Queue Data Structure: It follows FIFO (first in, first out) order for operations, so the item stored first will be the first to be accessed. \\x00 \\nLinked List Data Structure: Elements in this data structure are connected through a series of nodes, each containing data items and the address \\nof the next node. \\x00Non-linear Data Structure Here, data elements are not arranged in a sequence, and all elements can’t be traversed in a single run. Common non-\\nlinear data structures are: \\x00 Tree Data Structure: A hierarchical data structure where elements are placed in a tree-like structure. It contains a \\ncentral node, structural nodes, and sub-nodes connected via edges. Tree-based data structures are Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, B- Tree, B+ \\nTree, AVL Tree, and Red-Black Tree. \\x00 Graph Data Structure: Consists of vertices and edges, and a pair of nodes is connected through edges. It \\nis used to solve complex problems. 4. Explain the difference between a File Structure and a Storage Structure. The difference is that the storage \\nstructure has data stored in the memory of the computer system, whereas the file structure has the data stored in the auxiliary memory. File \\nStructure Storage Structure Represent data in auxiliary memory, Data is stored in the computer such as disk and pen drive. memory, i.e., RAM \\nand disk. Data is intact until deleted manually. Once the function using the data gets executed, it is deleted from the memory. Standard storage \\npolicies. Customized storage policies. Compatibility with external apps is Highly low. apps. compatible It is one of the most asked data \\nstructure interview question for freshers. with external \\x005. What is a stack data structure? What are the applications of a stack? A stack data structure represents the state of an application at a \\nspecific point in time. It consists of a series of elements arranged in a linear structure like a real physical stack or pile where you add or \\nremoves items from the top. This linear data structure follows a particular order, LIFO (Last In First Out) and FILO (First In Last Out), to perform \\noperations. Elements are arranged in a sequence, so the item added last will be restricted first. A real-life example is a stack of clothes where \\nthe cloth placed on the top, or the last to be added, will be the first to be picked. Applications of a stack data structure are: \\x00 Temporary storage \\nduring recursive operations \\x00 Reversing a string \\x00 Redo and Undo operations in doc editors \\x00 Parenthesis matching \\x00 Syntax parsing \\x00 Postfix, \\nprefix, and infix expressions \\x00 Backtracking 6. What operations can be performed on a stack? Common operations that can be performed in a \\nstack data structure are: push(): It inserts a new element at the top of the stack. However, before we insert a value, it is important to verify if \\nTOP=MAX–1. If the stack is filled, no more insertion is possible, and you can see an OVERFLOW message if y try to put an element in the \\nalready-filled stack. pop(): Its basic function is to remove an element from the top of the stack. Before you retrieve an item, verify if TOP=NULL. \\nIf the stack is empty, no further deletions are allowed, and you will get an UNDERFLOW message if you try to remove an element from an empty \\nstack. \\x00peek(): It returns a value of the top-most element in the stack but doesn\\'t remove it from the data elements collection. isFull(): To check if the \\nstack has reached its maximum capacity of data insertion. isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty or not. size(): To find the number of \\nelements in a stack. 7. Explain what multidimensional arrays is. A multidimensional array spans across more than one dimension, which means \\nit has more than one index variable for each storage point. It has multiple layers and is primarily used where data can’t be stored or represented \\nin one dimension. Basic multidimensional arrays are 2D and 3D arrays. It’s technically an array of different arrays. A 2D array, also known as a \\nmatrix or a table, consists of rows and columns. 8. What is a binary search tree? It is a type of data structure that stores data elements \\nefficiently. Here, each node stores a key and a value. The former is used to access an item, while the latter is used to find if the item is present \\nor not. A key is constant and defines the dataset (e.g., colour, gender, price), while a value is variable and belong to any of the dataset (e.g., red, \\nfemale/male, 100). A binary search tree has a specific order to place elements and is known for three qualities: \\x00 The values of elements of \\nnodes in the left sub-tree are less or equal to that of the root nodes. \\x00 Moreover, the values of the right root nodes are higher or equal to the root \\nnode. \\x00 Both the left and right sub-tree are two individual binary search trees at all points in time. Major applications of binary search trees are: \\x00\\x00 For indexing and multi-level indexing \\x00 For organising and sorting data \\x00 For implementing different search algorithms 9. What is a linked list \\ndata structure? A linked list data structure is a sequence of elements that are not stored in adjacent memory locations. The elements in this \\ndata structure use pointers to form a chain. Think of it as a series of linked nodes (each element or node representing a separate object) \\nconnected by paths or links. Every node has two items- a data field and a reference to the next node. Each link is an entry into the linked list, and \\nevery entry point, also known as the head, points to the next node. In an empty list, the head is a null reference, with the last node consisting of \\na reference to the null. The order to add nodes to the list is based on the order in which they are created. A linked list data structure doesn\\'t have \\na fixed number of nodes, and the list can grow or shrink as per demand. Some of the key applications of a linked list data structure are as \\nfollows: \\x00 Dealing with the unknown number of elements \\x00 Implementing queue, stack, graphs, and binary trees data structures \\x00 Accessing \\nelements randomly is not required \\x00 Round-robin scheduling for an operating system \\x00 Real-time computing when time predictability is \\nimportant \\x00 Forward and backward operation in the browser \\x00 Interesting items in the middle of the list \\x00 Dynamic management for Operating \\nSystem memory 10. Are linked lists linear or non-linear data structures? Linked lists can be linear and non-linear data structures based on their \\nusage. If it’s used for storage, it’s non-linear, but if it’s used for access or retrieval strategies, it’s considered a linear data structure. \\x0011. What are the pros of a linked list over an array? In which scenarios do we use a linked list and when array? The benefits of a linked list over \\nan array are: a) Dynamic Data Structure The linked list is a dynamic data structure, so there is no need for an initial size. It grows and shrinks at \\nruntime through memory allocation and deallocation. In an array, size is limited because the number of elements is stored statistically in the \\nmemory. b) Insertion and Deletion Node insertion and deletion are easier as you just have to update the address present in the next pointer. \\nHowever, it is expensive in an array because you need to create room for new elements by shifting existing elements. c) Implementation \\nImplementing stack and queue data structures using a linked list is easier. With an array, implementing data structures is complex. d) Memory \\nUsage A linked list can be decreased or increased based on the demand of the program, and memory is allocated only when needed, so there is \\nno memory wastage. An array cause more memory wastage. For example, if we store five elements in an array when the size is 10, then the \\nremaining space will be wasted. A linked list is used when: \\x00 A large number of operations are added or removed. \\x00 You want to insert an item in \\nthe middle of a list, like implementing a priority queue. \\x00 You already know the upper limit of a number of elements. Some common cases when \\nan array is preferred over a linked list: \\x00 You need to randomly access or index data elements. \\x00 You need to iterate through all elements quickly. \\n\\x00 You already know the number of elements in an array, so you can allocate the correct amount of memory. \\x00\\x00 In case memory is a major concern, arrays use less memory than linked lists because each element in an array is data, whereas each node in \\na linked list requires data and one or more pointers to other elements. In a nutshell, it comes to time, space, and ease of implementation while \\ndeciding between a linked list and an array. 12. What is a doubly-linked list? Give some examples. The doubly-linked list is a double-ended \\ncomplex linked list with two links in a node. One of them connects to the next adjacent node in the sequence, while the second one connects to \\nthe previous node. This enables traversal in both directions. Some of the examples of a doubly-linked list are: \\x00 Browser cache with back-\\nforward visited pages \\x00 Song playlist with next and previous buttons \\x00 Undo and redo functionality 13. What is FIFO? FIFO stands for First in, \\nFirst out order, representing the way and order in which data is accessed. The data element stored first in the list is the first entity to be removed \\nfrom the data structure. 14. What is the working of LIFO? LIFO stands for Last in, First out order and directly corresponds to how data is \\naccessed and modified. The data element stored last in the stack is the first one to be worked on at any point in time. If the first one doesn’t \\nneed to be accessed, you need to retrieve the data after that element. 15. How are the elements of a 2D array stored in the memory? a) Row-\\nMajor Order Rows of a 2D array are stored contiguously. The first row is stored in the memory, then the second row of the array, then the third, \\nand so on until the final row. b) Column-Major Order All the columns are stored in the same order. In the beginning, the first column is stored in \\nthe memory, then the second column, and so on, until the last column is saved in the memory. So, these are the common data structure \\ninterview questions for freshers. \\x00Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Interview Questions 16. What is an algorithm? An algorithm shows a step-by-step process to solve a \\nproblem or manipulate data. It is a set of instructions to be executed in a specific order to get the desired results. 17. Why do we need to do an \\nalgorithm analysis? A problem can be resolved in multiple ways with different algorithms. Using algorithm analysis, we can estimate the \\nrequired resources to solve a particular computation problem. We can determine the amount of time and space resources needed. The time \\ncomplexity determines the amount of time required for an algorithm to run as a function of input length, and the space complexity determines \\nthe amount of space or memory consumed by an algorithm. 18. What are different sorting algorithms? Which is the fastest of them? Different \\nsorting algorithms are: \\x00 Quicksort \\x00 Bubble sort \\x00 Radix sort \\x00 Balloon sort \\x00 Merge sort Among all the options available, putting one on the \\npodium for enhanced and fastest performance is neither fair nor possible. Each sorting algorithm serves a specific purpose, and its \\nperformance varies according to the data, the way it’s stored, and the reaction once the algorithm processes the data. 19. What is an \\nasymptotic analysis of an algorithm? Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm is a technique to determine its run-time performance according to the \\nmathematical units. It is used to find the best case (Omega Notation, Ω), worst case (Big Oh Notation, O), and average case (Theta Notation, θ) \\nperformances of an algorithm. It is not a deep learning method but an essential tool for programmers to analyse the efficiency of an algorithm. \\x0020. What is a queue data structure? A queue data structure supports systematic operations, i.e., elements are accessed and manipulated in a \\nspecific order. It follows FIFO (First in, First out) method, so elements are added to the queue one after the other from the rear end and are \\nremoved or processed on the front end. It is similar to the literal queues in the real world. Unlike stack, it is open at both ends, with one end \\nbeing used to insert elements and another one to remove them. Queues are commonly used when users want to store items for a long period. \\n21. What is a priority queue? What are the applications for the priority queue? A priority queue is a type of abstract data resembling a normal \\nqueue, but here, each element is assigned a priority value. The order of elements in the priority queue determines their priority. So, the elements \\nwith higher priority are processed first. In case two or more elements have the same priority, they are processed in the order they appear in the \\nqueue. Some real-life applications of the priority queue are: \\x00 Huffman code for data compression \\x00 Graph algorithms like Prim’s Minimum \\nspanning tree \\x00 Robotics to plan and execute tasks based on priorities. Be prepared for this type of interview questions in data structures, as \\nthese are often asked to both freshers and experienced professionals. 22. List some applications of queue Data Structure. A queue is used to \\nmanage a group of elements in FIFO (First in, First out) order. A few of its applications are: \\x00 Call management in call centres \\x00 Buffers in MP3 \\nplayers and CD players \\x00 Handling interruptions in real-time systems \\x00 In graphs for a breadth-first search algorithm \\x00\\x00 Waiting lists or serving requests for a single shared resource like CPU, image uploads, printer, etc. \\x00 Operating system: CPU scheduling, job \\nscheduling operations, and Disk scheduling. \\x00 Manage a playlist in media players, for example adding or removing a song \\x00 Asynchronous \\ntransfer of data 23. What operations can be performed on queues? Different operations that can be performed on queues are: \\x00 dequeue() \\nremoves an element from the queue. If the queue is empty, you get UNDERFLOW notification. \\x00 enqueue() adds an element to the queue. If the \\nqueue is full, it will be an overflow condition. \\x00 isEmpty is to check if the queue is empty or not. \\x00 init() initialises the queue. \\x00 front is used to find \\nthe value of the first element without removing it. \\x00 rear returns the last or rear element from the queue. 24. What is a Deque? A deque is a \\ndouble-ended queue. It is like an array of items, but rather than adding or removing elements from only one end, a deque allows elements to be \\ninserted at either end. This feature makes deque suitable for various tasks, such as scheduling, keeping track of inventory, and handling a large \\namount of data. Moreover, it can be used as a stack and queue and performs better than stacks and linked lists. 25. What are the different \\ntypes of deque? What are its applications? There are two main types of deque: a) Input Restricted Deque Here, insertion is performed at one \\nend, but deletion is performed at both ends. \\x00b) Output Restricted Deque Insertion is performed at both ends while deletion is performed at one end. Some real-life applications of a deque \\ndata structure are: \\x00 To store web browser history \\x00 As it supports all data structure operations, it can be used as a stack and queue. \\x00 \\nOperating system job scheduling algorithm Interview Questions on Data Structures For Experienced Professionals 26. What are the advantages \\nof the heap over a stack? Some major advantages of heap over stack are as follows: \\x00 A heap is more flexible than a stack. \\x00 With a heap, it is \\npossible to allocate or de-allocate memory space dynamically. \\x00 The heap is used to store data elements in Java, while the stack is used for \\nvariables. \\x00 When you use recursion, heap memory size is more, but in the case of stack memory, it fills up quickly. \\x00 Objects in a heap are \\nvisible to all threads, whereas variables are stored as private memory in the stack and are visible to only the owner. 27. What is the difference \\nbetween PUSH and a POP? Push and pop are the two key data structure activities that stand for Pushing and Popping. These operations signify \\nthe way data is stored and retrieved in a stack. Push- It denotes that a user is adding an element to the stack. \\x00 It requires the name of the stack \\nand the value of the entity. \\x00 In case the stack is filled but you still use the ‘Push’ command, you’ll get an ‘overflow’ error, indicating that the stack \\ncan no longer accommodate another element. Pop- It is an activity to retrieve or pull elements from the stack. \\x00\\x00 It only needs the name of the stack. \\x00 When you try to pull an element from an empty stack, you see an ‘underflow’ error. When we talk about \\nadding or removing an element, it refers to the top-most available data. 28. What is the merge sort? How does it work? Merge sort is based on \\nthe divide and conquer method. Here, the data is divided and sorted to attain the end goal. The adjacent data elements are merged and sorted \\nin each iteration to create bigger sorted lists, which are combined recursively until there is a single sorted list. 29. How is a variable stored in \\nmemory when using data structures? A variable is stored according to the required amount of memory. The steps to store a variable in memory \\nare as follows: \\x00 It starts by assigning the amount of memory that is needed. \\x00 It is stored as per the data structure. \\x00 Dynamic allocation \\nensures enhanced efficiency, and one can access units based on their real-time requirements. 30. What is dynamic memory management? In \\nthe dynamic memory management technique, storage units are allocated according to the requirements. Dynamic memory allocation allows \\nstoring each data structure either separately or together to form entities known as composites. You can work on these entities whenever \\nrequired. 31. What is a postfix expression? Post-fix expression consists of operators and operands, and every operator precedes the operands. \\nWith the concept of operator precedence, it eliminates the need for using parentheses or sub-expressions. 32. What is a binary tree? A binary \\ntree is used to organise data, making data retrieval and manipulation efficient. This data structure has two nodes, left and right, called leaves \\nand nodes. Leaves represent data, while nodes represent relationships between leaves. \\x00Every node has two children, also known as siblings, with each child having one parent. The parent node is closest to the root tree. If a node is \\ndeleted from the tree, it gets deleted from its child and parent. According to programming language, a binary tree is an extension to the linked \\nlist. 33. What are the applications of binary trees? Common applications of a binary tree are: \\x00 In data compression methods in the Huffman \\ncoding tree \\x00 Display hierarchical data \\x00 Search for a specific element \\x00 Put priority queues into action \\x00 Implement file systems where every \\nindividual node represents a directory or file. \\x00 Implement decision trees, a machine learning algorithm for classification and regression \\nanalysis. \\x00 In editing apps of spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel \\x00 Encoding and decoding operations \\x00 Implement efficient sorting algorithms \\n34. What is the AVL tree data structure? An AVL tree, named after its inventors Adelson, Velskii, and Landi, is the highest-balancing binary \\nsearch tree. It compares the heights of the left and right subtrees of nodes and ensures that the difference is less than or equal to one. The \\ndifference is called the Balance Factor. It is used for a large set of data with continuous pruning through insertion and deletion. 35. List the \\noperations, rotations, and applications of an AVL tree. An AVL tree is used to perform the following operations: a) Insertion Although insertion in \\nan AVL tree is the same as in a binary search tree, it may cause a violation of the property. Hence, the tree must be balanced, for which \\nrotations can be used. \\x00b) Deletion It is also the same as in the binary search tree. However, deletion can lead to disruption in the tree’s balance, so rotations are used to \\nbalance it. To balance an AVL tree, it performs the following rotations: c) Left Rotation When inserting a node into the right subtree of the right \\nsubtree cause the tree to be unbalanced, users need to perform a single left rotation. d) Right Rotation If the tree is unbalanced because of \\ninsertion in the left subtree of the left subtree, it requires a single right rotation. e) Left-Right Rotation It is the extended version of the single \\nrotation and is also known as double rotation. When node insertion is into the right subtree of the left subtree, a left rotation is followed by a \\nright rotation to balance the tree. f) Right-Left Rotation When node insertion is done into the left subtree of the right subtree, a right rotation is \\nfollowed by a left rotation. Here are a few real-life applications of an AVL tree: \\x00 In-memory sets and dictionaries \\x00 Database applications with \\nfewer insertions and deletions but frequent data lookups. \\x00 Applications that need enhanced searching. 36. What is the difference between the \\nB tree and the B+ tree? a) B Tree It refers to a self-balancing m-way tree, where ‘m’ signifies the tree’s order. It is an extension of the binary \\nsearch tree where nodes can have more than two children and one key. The data is sorted in a B tree with lower values placed on the left \\nsubtree while higher values are placed on the right subtree. \\x00b) B+ Tree It refers to an advanced self-balanced tree where every path from the root to the leaf is of the same length. This shows that all the \\npaths occurred at the same level. So, when all leaf nodes appear on the second level, no other lead node can appear on the third level. 37. What \\nare the applications for B-trees? Before discussing the real-life applications of B-tress, let’s have a look at some of its properties: The following \\nare the key properties of a B-tree data structure: \\x00 All the leaves are at the same height. \\x00 Minimum degree ‘t’ refers to a B-tree, and its value is \\ndetermined by the disk block size. \\x00 Each node must have at least t-1 keys. The root is the only exception to this, which must contain at least \\none key. \\x00 In B-tree, node insertion happens at Leaf Node. \\x00 The number of children of a node= number of keys in the node plus one. \\x00 Unlike the \\nbinary search tree, which grows and shrinks from downward, B-tree grows and shrinks from the root. \\x00 Nodes, including root, can’t have more \\nthan 2*t-1 keys. \\x00 Keys are sorted in ascending order. A child between k1 and k2 consists of all keys ranging from k1 to k2. The applications of \\nB-tree are: \\x00 In CAD systems, to sort and search geometric data. \\x00 In the case of a large database, to access data stored on a disc \\x00 Most \\nservers use B-tree \\x00 To achieve multilevel indexing \\x00 To search data in less time \\x00 In areas such as computer networks, natural language \\nprocessing (NLP), and cryptography. It is among the top interview questions in data structures. \\x0038. What is a graph data structure? It is a non-linear data structure with nodes or vertices connected by a set of ordered edges. These edges are \\nlines or arcs connecting two nodes in a graph so that data can be accessed and stored based on requirements. 39. What are the applications of \\na graph data structure? Real-time applications of a graph data structure are: \\x00 Social network graphs to track users\\' data. \\x00 Google Maps for \\nbuilding transportation systems \\x00 Transport grids with stations represented as vertices and routes as edges \\x00 Dijkstra algorithm to determine \\nthe smallest path between two or more nodes \\x00 Utility graph or water or power with vertices representing connection points and edges of the \\nwires. \\x00 Operating System, in the Resource Allocation Graph where each process and resource are represented as vertices \\x00 World Wide Web, \\nwhere web pages are considered as vertices \\x00 Computer science to represent the flow of computation Advanced Data Structure Interview \\nQuestions 40. What is the difference between the Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS)? Breadth First Search (BFS) Depth \\nFirst Search (DFS) \\x00Uses Queue data structure to find the Uses the Stack data structure to shortest path. find the shortest path. Need to walk through all the nodes \\nBegins at the root node and then on the same level to go to the next proceeds level in BFS. through all the nodes to reach the as far as possible \\nnode with no unvisited nearby nodes. It is slower. Faster compared to BFS. Performs better if the target is closer Performs better if the target is \\nto the source. farther from the source. Needs more memory. Needs less memory. No backtracking is possible. As it is a recursive algorithm, it \\nemploys the backtracking. Based on the FIFO principle (First In Based on the LIFO principle (Last First Out). In First Out). 41. How do you find \\nthe height of a node in a tree? The height of a node is equal to the number of edges in the longest path to the leaf from that node. Here, the \\ndepth of a leaf node is zero. I) List the types of trees. a) General Tree A generic tree with no constrained hierarchy. Here, nodes can have an \\nendless number of offspring and the rest of the trees are subsets of the tree. \\x00b) Binary Tree It is the most commonly-known tree. Here, each parent has a minimum of two offspring, which are called the left and right \\nyoungsters. When a binary tree has certain features and limitations, other trees, such as RBT, AVL, and binary search trees, are used. c) Binary \\nSearch Tree Also known as BST, it is an extension of a binary tree with various optional constraints. The left child value of a node should be less \\nthan or equal to the parent value, and the correct child value should be higher than or equal to the parent value. e) Red and Black Tree It is an \\nauto-balancing tree with red or black nodes. Hence, the name Red-Black Tree. It keeps the forest balanced. The tree might not be balanced, but \\nthe searching process takes O(log n) time. f) N-ary Tree N represents the maximum number of children. In this tree, every node’s children are \\neither 0 or N. 42. How does bubble sort work? A bubble sort is a commonly-used sorting method appalled to arrays where adjacent elements \\nare compared to each other. Also, values are exchanged as per the order followed in the arrangement. It is named bubble sort as it involves \\nexchanging elements like bubbles floating in the water and larger entities sinking to the bottom. 43. What is a Jagged array? A jagged array is \\nused to store rows of data elements of varying sizes and dimensions. It enhances efficiency while working with multidimensional arrays. 44. \\nHow do you find a loop in a linked list? There are multiple ways to detect a loop in a linked list. One can use the following methods: \\x00 Hashing \\x00 \\nFloyd’s cycle-finding algorithm \\x00 Visited nodes method \\x0045. What are the advantages of a binary search over a linear search? \\x00 A binary search is comparatively more efficient than a linear search as it \\ninvolves fewer comparisons. \\x00 Linear search allows you to eliminate only one element per comparison each time you fail to find the value you \\nwant. However, a binary search allows you to eliminate half the data set with each comparison. \\x00 The binary search runs in O(log n) time while \\nthe linear search runs in O(n) time. So, the more elements in the search array, the faster the binary search is. 46. What is a heap data structure? \\nHeap is a unique tree-based non-linear data structure with a complete binary tree. It means that all the levels are filled except possibly the last \\none, which consists of all the elements, and all the nodes are left-justified. Broadly, a heap is of two types: \\x00 Max-Heap: The value of the root \\nnode must be greatest from all other keys of its children node. The same is recursively true for all sub-trees in that binary tree. \\x00 Min-Heap: The \\nvalue of the key at the root node must be the smallest among all keys of the children node. The same stands recursively true for all other sub-\\ntrees in that binary tree. 47. Define Red-Black Tree. A red-black tree is a binary tree invented in 1972 by Rudolf Bayer and was dubbed as \\n\"symmetric binary B-tree”. It is a self-balancing binary tree that stores data in two’s complementary binary formats. Each node is either red or \\nblack, and by comparing these colours on a path from root to leaf, the tree ensures that the path is not more than twice as long as others, \\nmaking it balanced. It can be used to store any kind of data represented as a set of values. Although it is similar to a binary tree, there is one \\ndifference. The read-black tree is faster to access, making it suitable for storing a large amount of data. \\x0048. What is a Trie data structure? Trie stands for ‘Retrieval’ and is also known as the prefix tree or digital tree. It stores a set of strings in the \\nform of a sorted tree. Let’s say strings range from letters ‘a to z’ of the English alphabet, so each trie node can’t have more than 26 points. Also, \\nevery individual node has the same number of pointers as alphabet characters. This data structure can check the work in the dictionary by its \\nprefix. Moreover, it allows you to print all words alphabetically, which is an advantage over hashing. It ensures efficient prefix search or auto-\\ncomplete. The key to which each node is connected is based on its position in the Trie data structure. You can add or find strings in O(L) time, \\nwhere L = Length of a single word. This is a faster way than BST and hashing, considering the way it is implemented. You don’t need to compute \\na hash function or manage collisions like in open addressing or separate chaining. 49. Explain the Segment Tree data structure. As the name \\nsuggests, a segment tree data structure stores segments or intervals. It is a binary tree comprising nodes representing intervals. It is used in \\ncase there are multiple changes in array elements or various range queries on an array. Its operations include: \\x00 Building Tree: To create a data \\nstructure and initialise the segment tree variable. \\x00 Querying Tree: To run a range query on an array. \\x00 Updating the Tree: To change the tree by \\nupdating the value of an array at a certain point over an interval. A few real-time applications of segment tree data structure are: \\x00 Computation \\ngeometry \\x00 Pattern recognition and image processing \\x00 Storing segments randomly \\x00 Calculate range max/min, prefix sum/product, range sum/\\nproduct, etc. \\x00 Static and dynamic RMQ \\x00 Geographic information system \\x00Upskill Yourself With Expert-led Online Training Programs! \\x00 Web Development Course \\x00 Wordpress Course \\x00 Mern Stack Course \\x00 Full Stack \\nDeveloper Course \\x00 HTML Course \\x00 React Js Course \\x00 Javascript Course \\x00 PHP Curse \\x00 Power BI Course \\x00 Tableau Course \\x00 Data Science \\nCourse \\x00 Python Course \\x00 Data Analytics Course \\x00 Ethical Hacking Course \\x00 Penetration Testing Course \\x00 Cyber Security Course View All \\nCourses All Courses Include: \\x00 Regular Live Classes \\x00 Mentorship by Industry Experts \\x00 Dedicated Doubt Sessions \\x00 Industry-recognized \\nCertification \\x00 Career Support \\x00\\x00')]\n"

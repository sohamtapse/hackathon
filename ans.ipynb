      "RAG stands for **Retrieval Augmented Generation**.  It's a technique used in large language models (LLMs) to improve their performance and factual accuracy.  Instead of relying solely on the knowledge embedded within the model itself, RAG augments the model's capabilities by allowing it to access and process external information from a knowledge base or document store during generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Retrieval:** The model first receives a prompt or question.  A retrieval component then searches a relevant knowledge base (which could be a database, a set of documents, or even the entire web) to find information pertinent to the prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Augmentation:** The retrieved information is then \"augmented\" into the model's input.  This means the retrieved text is added to the original prompt before the model generates its response.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Generation:** Finally, the LLM generates a response based on both its internal knowledge and the newly retrieved external information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key benefit of RAG is that it allows LLMs to access and utilize up-to-date information that wasn't present during their training.  This helps address the limitations of traditional LLMs, which can sometimes hallucinate facts or provide outdated information.  However, it also adds complexity, requiring careful consideration of the knowledge base's quality, the retrieval method's efficiency, and potential biases in the retrieved information.\n"

      "[Document(metadata={'source': 'context.txt'}, page_content='Top 50 Data Structures Interview Questions\\nAnd Answers PDF\\n\\nData Structure Interview Questions for Freshers\\n1. What is a data structure?\\nA data structure is a mechanical way to organise, align, and manipulate data as per\\nrequirements. It is not restricted to putting data in a table but deals with different datasets\\nand how well they are aligned.\\nThe aim is to ensure that data can be organised and accessed efficiently. Data organisation\\ndetermines how a program performs. Moreover, data dependency and relationships between\\ntwo or more datasets play a crucial role in data structures.\\nWhile designing code, we need to pay utmost attention to how data is structured because\\nincorrectly structured or inefficiently stored data can hamper the overall performance of the\\ncode.\\n\\n2. What are the applications of data structures?\\nData structures are applied across multiple industries and domains as algorithms are the\\nprimary requirements in every business. Here are the major applications of data structures:\\n●\\n\\nNumerical and statistical analysis\\n\\n\\x0c●\\n\\nCompiler design\\n\\n●\\n\\nArtificial intelligence\\n\\n●\\n\\nDatabase management\\n\\n●\\n\\nGraphical processing\\n\\n●\\n\\nLexical analysis\\n\\n●\\n\\nBlockchain\\n\\n●\\n\\nDecision making\\n\\n●\\n\\nOperating system design\\n\\n●\\n\\nSimulation\\n\\n3. Describe the types of data structures.\\nData structures are divided into two categories:\\n●\\n\\nLinear data structure\\n\\n●\\n\\nNon-linear data structure\\n\\nLinear Data Structure\\nIt includes data elements that are arranged sequentially or linearly. Also, each element is\\nconnected to its previous or next adjacent element.\\nTypes of linear data structure\\n●\\n●\\n\\nStatic Data Structure: It has a fixed memory size, and it’s easier to access data\\nelements. An example includes Array.\\nDynamic Data Structure: Size is not fixed and can be updated randomly. Examples\\ninclude Queue and Stack.\\n\\nCommon linear data structures\\n●\\n\\nArray Data Structure: All the elements or values are of the same type.\\n\\n●\\n\\nStack Data Structure: It follows LIFO (Last in, first out) order to perform operations,\\nso the last element to be stored will be the first to be retrieved.\\n\\n●\\n\\nQueue Data Structure: It follows FIFO (first in, first out) order for operations, so the\\nitem stored first will be the first to be accessed.\\n\\n●\\n\\nLinked List Data Structure: Elements in this data structure are connected through a\\nseries of nodes, each containing data items and the address of the next node.\\n\\n\\x0cNon-linear Data Structure\\nHere, data elements are not arranged in a sequence, and all elements can’t be traversed in\\na single run. Common non-linear data structures are:\\n●\\n\\nTree Data Structure: A hierarchical data structure where elements are placed in a\\ntree-like structure. It contains a central node, structural nodes, and sub-nodes\\nconnected via edges. Tree-based data structures are Binary Tree, Binary Search\\nTree, B- Tree, B+ Tree, AVL Tree, and Red-Black Tree.\\n\\n●\\n\\nGraph Data Structure: Consists of vertices and edges, and a pair of nodes is\\nconnected through edges. It is used to solve complex problems.\\n\\n4. Explain the difference between a File Structure and a Storage\\nStructure.\\nThe difference is that the storage structure has data stored in the memory of the computer\\nsystem, whereas the file structure has the data stored in the auxiliary memory.\\n\\nFile Structure\\n\\nStorage Structure\\n\\nRepresent data in auxiliary memory,\\n\\nData is stored in the computer\\n\\nsuch as disk and pen drive.\\n\\nmemory, i.e., RAM and disk.\\n\\nData is intact until deleted manually.\\n\\nOnce the function using the data\\ngets executed, it is deleted from the\\nmemory.\\n\\nStandard storage policies.\\n\\nCustomized storage policies.\\n\\nCompatibility with external apps is\\n\\nHighly\\n\\nlow.\\n\\napps.\\n\\ncompatible\\n\\nIt is one of the most asked data structure interview question for freshers.\\n\\nwith\\n\\nexternal\\n\\n\\x0c5. What is a stack data structure? What are the applications of a\\nstack?\\nA stack data structure represents the state of an application at a specific point in time. It\\nconsists of a series of elements arranged in a linear structure like a real physical stack or\\npile where you add or removes items from the top.\\nThis linear data structure follows a particular order, LIFO (Last In First Out) and FILO (First\\nIn Last Out), to perform operations.\\nElements are arranged in a sequence, so the item added last will be restricted first. A\\nreal-life example is a stack of clothes where the cloth placed on the top, or the last to be\\nadded, will be the first to be picked.\\nApplications of a stack data structure are:\\n●\\n\\nTemporary storage during recursive operations\\n\\n●\\n\\nReversing a string\\n\\n●\\n\\nRedo and Undo operations in doc editors\\n\\n●\\n\\nParenthesis matching\\n\\n●\\n\\nSyntax parsing\\n\\n●\\n\\nPostfix, prefix, and infix expressions\\n\\n●\\n\\nBacktracking\\n\\n6. What operations can be performed on a stack?\\nCommon operations that can be performed in a stack data structure are:\\n\\npush():\\nIt inserts a new element at the top of the stack. However, before we insert a value, it is\\nimportant to verify if TOP=MAX–1. If the stack is filled, no more insertion is possible, and you\\ncan see an OVERFLOW message if y try to put an element in the already-filled stack.\\n\\npop():\\nIts basic function is to remove an element from the top of the stack. Before you retrieve an\\nitem, verify if TOP=NULL. If the stack is empty, no further deletions are allowed, and you will\\nget an UNDERFLOW message if you try to remove an element from an empty stack.\\n\\n\\x0cpeek():\\nIt returns a value of the top-most element in the stack but doesn\\'t remove it from the data\\nelements collection.\\n\\nisFull():\\nTo check if the stack has reached its maximum capacity of data insertion.\\n\\nisEmpty():\\nChecks if the stack is empty or not.\\n\\nsize():\\nTo find the number of elements in a stack.\\n\\n7. Explain what multidimensional arrays is.\\nA multidimensional array spans across more than one dimension, which means it has more\\nthan one index variable for each storage point. It has multiple layers and is primarily used\\nwhere data can’t be stored or represented in one dimension.\\nBasic multidimensional arrays are 2D and 3D arrays. It’s technically an array of different\\narrays. A 2D array, also known as a matrix or a table, consists of rows and columns.\\n\\n8. What is a binary search tree?\\nIt is a type of data structure that stores data elements efficiently. Here, each node stores a\\nkey and a value. The former is used to access an item, while the latter is used to find if the\\nitem is present or not.\\nA key is constant and defines the dataset (e.g., colour, gender, price), while a value is\\nvariable and belong to any of the dataset (e.g., red, female/male, 100).\\nA binary search tree has a specific order to place elements and is known for three\\nqualities:\\n●\\n\\nThe values of elements of nodes in the left sub-tree are less or equal to that of the\\nroot nodes.\\n\\n●\\n\\nMoreover, the values of the right root nodes are higher or equal to the root node.\\n\\n●\\n\\nBoth the left and right sub-tree are two individual binary search trees at all points in\\ntime.\\n\\nMajor applications of binary search trees are:\\n\\n\\x0c●\\n\\nFor indexing and multi-level indexing\\n\\n●\\n\\nFor organising and sorting data\\n\\n●\\n\\nFor implementing different search algorithms\\n\\n9. What is a linked list data structure?\\nA linked list data structure is a sequence of elements that are not stored in adjacent memory\\nlocations. The elements in this data structure use pointers to form a chain. Think of it as a\\nseries of linked nodes (each element or node representing a separate object) connected by\\npaths or links. Every node has two items- a data field and a reference to the next node.\\nEach link is an entry into the linked list, and every entry point, also known as the head,\\npoints to the next node. In an empty list, the head is a null reference, with the last node\\nconsisting of a reference to the null.\\nThe order to add nodes to the list is based on the order in which they are created. A linked\\nlist data structure doesn\\'t have a fixed number of nodes, and the list can grow or shrink as\\nper demand.\\nSome of the key applications of a linked list data structure are as follows:\\n●\\n\\nDealing with the unknown number of elements\\n\\n●\\n\\nImplementing queue, stack, graphs, and binary trees data structures\\n\\n●\\n\\nAccessing elements randomly is not required\\n\\n●\\n\\nRound-robin scheduling for an operating system\\n\\n●\\n\\nReal-time computing when time predictability is important\\n\\n●\\n\\nForward and backward operation in the browser\\n\\n●\\n\\nInteresting items in the middle of the list\\n\\n●\\n\\nDynamic management for Operating System memory\\n\\n10. Are linked lists linear or non-linear data structures?\\nLinked lists can be linear and non-linear data structures based on their usage. If it’s used for\\nstorage, it’s non-linear, but if it’s used for access or retrieval strategies, it’s considered a\\nlinear data structure.\\n\\n\\x0c11. What are the pros of a linked list over an array? In which\\nscenarios do we use a linked list and when array?\\nThe benefits of a linked list over an array are:\\n\\na) Dynamic Data Structure\\nThe linked list is a dynamic data structure, so there is no need for an initial size. It grows and\\nshrinks at runtime through memory allocation and deallocation.\\nIn an array, size is limited because the number of elements is stored statistically in the\\nmemory.\\n\\nb) Insertion and Deletion\\nNode insertion and deletion are easier as you just have to update the address present in the\\nnext pointer.\\nHowever, it is expensive in an array because you need to create room for new elements by\\nshifting existing elements.\\n\\nc) Implementation\\nImplementing stack and queue data structures using a linked list is easier.\\nWith an array, implementing data structures is complex.\\n\\nd) Memory Usage\\nA linked list can be decreased or increased based on the demand of the program, and\\nmemory is allocated only when needed, so there is no memory wastage.\\nAn array cause more memory wastage. For example, if we store five elements in an array\\nwhen the size is 10, then the remaining space will be wasted.\\nA linked list is used when:\\n●\\n\\nA large number of operations are added or removed.\\n\\n●\\n\\nYou want to insert an item in the middle of a list, like implementing a priority queue.\\n\\n●\\n\\nYou already know the upper limit of a number of elements.\\n\\nSome common cases when an array is preferred over a linked list:\\n●\\n\\nYou need to randomly access or index data elements.\\n\\n●\\n\\nYou need to iterate through all elements quickly.\\n\\n●\\n\\nYou already know the number of elements in an array, so you can allocate the correct\\namount of memory.\\n\\n\\x0c●\\n\\nIn case memory is a major concern, arrays use less memory than linked lists\\nbecause each element in an array is data, whereas each node in a linked list requires\\ndata and one or more pointers to other elements.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, it comes to time, space, and ease of implementation while deciding between a\\nlinked list and an array.\\n\\n12. What is a doubly-linked list? Give some examples.\\nThe doubly-linked list is a double-ended complex linked list with two links in a node. One of\\nthem connects to the next adjacent node in the sequence, while the second one connects to\\nthe previous node. This enables traversal in both directions. Some of the examples of a\\ndoubly-linked list are:\\n●\\n\\nBrowser cache with back-forward visited pages\\n\\n●\\n\\nSong playlist with next and previous buttons\\n\\n●\\n\\nUndo and redo functionality\\n\\n13. What is FIFO?\\nFIFO stands for First in, First out order, representing the way and order in which data is\\naccessed. The data element stored first in the list is the first entity to be removed from the\\ndata structure.\\n\\n14. What is the working of LIFO?\\nLIFO stands for Last in, First out order and directly corresponds to how data is accessed and\\nmodified. The data element stored last in the stack is the first one to be worked on at any\\npoint in time. If the first one doesn’t need to be accessed, you need to retrieve the data after\\nthat element.\\n\\n15. How are the elements of a 2D array stored in the memory?\\na) Row-Major Order\\nRows of a 2D array are stored contiguously. The first row is stored in the memory, then the\\nsecond row of the array, then the third, and so on until the final row.\\n\\nb) Column-Major Order\\nAll the columns are stored in the same order. In the beginning, the first column is stored in\\nthe memory, then the second column, and so on, until the last column is saved in the\\nmemory.\\nSo, these are the common data structure interview questions for freshers.\\n\\n\\x0cData Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Interview Questions\\n16. What is an algorithm?\\nAn algorithm shows a step-by-step process to solve a problem or manipulate data. It is a set\\nof instructions to be executed in a specific order to get the desired results.\\n\\n17. Why do we need to do an algorithm analysis?\\nA problem can be resolved in multiple ways with different algorithms. Using algorithm\\nanalysis, we can estimate the required resources to solve a particular computation problem.\\nWe can determine the amount of time and space resources needed.\\nThe time complexity determines the amount of time required for an algorithm to run as a\\nfunction of input length, and the space complexity determines the amount of space or\\nmemory consumed by an algorithm.\\n\\n18. What are different sorting algorithms? Which is the fastest of\\nthem?\\nDifferent sorting algorithms are:\\n●\\n\\nQuicksort\\n\\n●\\n\\nBubble sort\\n\\n●\\n\\nRadix sort\\n\\n●\\n\\nBalloon sort\\n\\n●\\n\\nMerge sort\\n\\nAmong all the options available, putting one on the podium for enhanced and fastest\\nperformance is neither fair nor possible. Each sorting algorithm serves a specific purpose,\\nand its performance varies according to the data, the way it’s stored, and the reaction once\\nthe algorithm processes the data.\\n\\n19. What is an asymptotic analysis of an algorithm?\\nAsymptotic analysis of an algorithm is a technique to determine its run-time performance\\naccording to the mathematical units.\\nIt is used to find the best case (Omega Notation, Ω), worst case (Big Oh Notation, O), and\\naverage case (Theta Notation, θ) performances of an algorithm. It is not a deep learning\\nmethod but an essential tool for programmers to analyse the efficiency of an algorithm.\\n\\n\\x0c20. What is a queue data structure?\\nA queue data structure supports systematic operations, i.e., elements are accessed and\\nmanipulated in a specific order. It follows FIFO (First in, First out) method, so elements are\\nadded to the queue one after the other from the rear end and are removed or processed on\\nthe front end.\\nIt is similar to the literal queues in the real world. Unlike stack, it is open at both ends, with\\none end being used to insert elements and another one to remove them. Queues are\\ncommonly used when users want to store items for a long period.\\n\\n21. What is a priority queue? What are the applications for the\\npriority queue?\\nA priority queue is a type of abstract data resembling a normal queue, but here, each\\nelement is assigned a priority value. The order of elements in the priority queue determines\\ntheir priority.\\nSo, the elements with higher priority are processed first. In case two or more elements have\\nthe same priority, they are processed in the order they appear in the queue.\\nSome real-life applications of the priority queue are:\\n●\\n\\nHuffman code for data compression\\n\\n●\\n\\nGraph algorithms like Prim’s Minimum spanning tree\\n\\n●\\n\\nRobotics to plan and execute tasks based on priorities.\\n\\nBe prepared for this type of interview questions in data structures, as these are often asked\\nto both freshers and experienced professionals.\\n\\n22. List some applications of queue Data Structure.\\nA queue is used to manage a group of elements in FIFO (First in, First out) order. A few of its\\napplications are:\\n●\\n\\nCall management in call centres\\n\\n●\\n\\nBuffers in MP3 players and CD players\\n\\n●\\n\\nHandling interruptions in real-time systems\\n\\n●\\n\\nIn graphs for a breadth-first search algorithm\\n\\n\\x0c●\\n\\nWaiting lists or serving requests for a single shared resource like CPU, image\\nuploads, printer, etc.\\n\\n●\\n\\nOperating system: CPU scheduling, job scheduling operations, and Disk scheduling.\\n\\n●\\n\\nManage a playlist in media players, for example adding or removing a song\\n\\n●\\n\\nAsynchronous transfer of data\\n\\n23. What operations can be performed on queues?\\nDifferent operations that can be performed on queues are:\\n●\\n\\ndequeue() removes an element from the queue. If the queue is empty, you get\\nUNDERFLOW notification.\\n\\n●\\n\\nenqueue() adds an element to the queue. If the queue is full, it will be an overflow\\ncondition.\\n\\n●\\n\\nisEmpty is to check if the queue is empty or not.\\n\\n●\\n\\ninit() initialises the queue.\\n\\n●\\n\\nfront is used to find the value of the first element without removing it.\\n\\n●\\n\\nrear returns the last or rear element from the queue.\\n\\n24. What is a Deque?\\nA deque is a double-ended queue. It is like an array of items, but rather than adding or\\nremoving elements from only one end, a deque allows elements to be inserted at either end.\\nThis feature makes deque suitable for various tasks, such as scheduling, keeping track of\\ninventory, and handling a large amount of data. Moreover, it can be used as a stack and\\nqueue and performs better than stacks and linked lists.\\n\\n25. What are the different types of deque? What are its\\napplications?\\nThere are two main types of deque:\\n\\na) Input Restricted Deque\\nHere, insertion is performed at one end, but deletion is performed at both ends.\\n\\n\\x0cb) Output Restricted Deque\\nInsertion is performed at both ends while deletion is performed at one end.\\nSome real-life applications of a deque data structure are:\\n●\\n\\nTo store web browser history\\n\\n●\\n\\nAs it supports all data structure operations, it can be used as a stack and queue.\\n\\n●\\n\\nOperating system job scheduling algorithm\\n\\nInterview Questions on Data Structures For Experienced\\nProfessionals\\n26. What are the advantages of the heap over a stack?\\nSome major advantages of heap over stack are as follows:\\n●\\n\\nA heap is more flexible than a stack.\\n\\n●\\n\\nWith a heap, it is possible to allocate or de-allocate memory space dynamically.\\n\\n●\\n\\nThe heap is used to store data elements in Java, while the stack is used for\\nvariables.\\n\\n●\\n\\nWhen you use recursion, heap memory size is more, but in the case of stack\\nmemory, it fills up quickly.\\n\\n●\\n\\nObjects in a heap are visible to all threads, whereas variables are stored as private\\nmemory in the stack and are visible to only the owner.\\n\\n27. What is the difference between PUSH and a POP?\\nPush and pop are the two key data structure activities that stand for Pushing and Popping.\\nThese operations signify the way data is stored and retrieved in a stack.\\nPush- It denotes that a user is adding an element to the stack.\\n●\\n\\nIt requires the name of the stack and the value of the entity.\\n\\n●\\n\\nIn case the stack is filled but you still use the ‘Push’ command, you’ll get an ‘overflow’\\nerror, indicating that the stack can no longer accommodate another element.\\n\\nPop- It is an activity to retrieve or pull elements from the stack.\\n\\n\\x0c●\\n\\nIt only needs the name of the stack.\\n\\n●\\n\\nWhen you try to pull an element from an empty stack, you see an ‘underflow’ error.\\n\\nWhen we talk about adding or removing an element, it refers to the top-most available data.\\n\\n28. What is the merge sort? How does it work?\\nMerge sort is based on the divide and conquer method. Here, the data is divided and sorted\\nto attain the end goal. The adjacent data elements are merged and sorted in each iteration\\nto create bigger sorted lists, which are combined recursively until there is a single sorted list.\\n\\n29. How is a variable stored in memory when using data\\nstructures?\\nA variable is stored according to the required amount of memory. The steps to store a\\nvariable in memory are as follows:\\n●\\n\\nIt starts by assigning the amount of memory that is needed.\\n\\n●\\n\\nIt is stored as per the data structure.\\n\\n●\\n\\nDynamic allocation ensures enhanced efficiency, and one can access units based on\\ntheir real-time requirements.\\n\\n30. What is dynamic memory management?\\nIn the dynamic memory management technique, storage units are allocated according to the\\nrequirements. Dynamic memory allocation allows storing each data structure either\\nseparately or together to form entities known as composites. You can work on these entities\\nwhenever required.\\n\\n31. What is a postfix expression?\\nPost-fix expression consists of operators and operands, and every operator precedes the\\noperands. With the concept of operator precedence, it eliminates the need for using\\nparentheses or sub-expressions.\\n\\n32. What is a binary tree?\\nA binary tree is used to organise data, making data retrieval and manipulation efficient. This\\ndata structure has two nodes, left and right, called leaves and nodes. Leaves represent data,\\nwhile nodes represent relationships between leaves.\\n\\n\\x0cEvery node has two children, also known as siblings, with each child having one parent. The\\nparent node is closest to the root tree. If a node is deleted from the tree, it gets deleted from\\nits child and parent. According to programming language, a binary tree is an extension to the\\nlinked list.\\n\\n33. What are the applications of binary trees?\\nCommon applications of a binary tree are:\\n●\\n\\nIn data compression methods in the Huffman coding tree\\n\\n●\\n\\nDisplay hierarchical data\\n\\n●\\n\\nSearch for a specific element\\n\\n●\\n\\nPut priority queues into action\\n\\n●\\n\\nImplement file systems where every individual node represents a directory or file.\\n\\n●\\n\\nImplement decision trees, a machine learning algorithm for classification and\\nregression analysis.\\n\\n●\\n\\nIn editing apps of spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel\\n\\n●\\n\\nEncoding and decoding operations\\n\\n●\\n\\nImplement efficient sorting algorithms\\n\\n34. What is the AVL tree data structure?\\nAn AVL tree, named after its inventors Adelson, Velskii, and Landi, is the highest-balancing\\nbinary search tree. It compares the heights of the left and right subtrees of nodes and\\nensures that the difference is less than or equal to one. The difference is called the Balance\\nFactor. It is used for a large set of data with continuous pruning through insertion and\\ndeletion.\\n\\n35. List the operations, rotations, and applications of an AVL tree.\\nAn AVL tree is used to perform the following operations:\\n\\na) Insertion\\nAlthough insertion in an AVL tree is the same as in a binary search tree, it may cause a\\nviolation of the property. Hence, the tree must be balanced, for which rotations can be used.\\n\\n\\x0cb) Deletion\\nIt is also the same as in the binary search tree. However, deletion can lead to disruption in\\nthe tree’s balance, so rotations are used to balance it.\\nTo balance an AVL tree, it performs the following rotations:\\n\\nc) Left Rotation\\nWhen inserting a node into the right subtree of the right subtree cause the tree to be\\nunbalanced, users need to perform a single left rotation.\\n\\nd) Right Rotation\\nIf the tree is unbalanced because of insertion in the left subtree of the left subtree, it requires\\na single right rotation.\\n\\ne) Left-Right Rotation\\nIt is the extended version of the single rotation and is also known as double rotation. When\\nnode insertion is into the right subtree of the left subtree, a left rotation is followed by a right\\nrotation to balance the tree.\\n\\nf) Right-Left Rotation\\nWhen node insertion is done into the left subtree of the right subtree, a right rotation is\\nfollowed by a left rotation.\\nHere are a few real-life applications of an AVL tree:\\n●\\n\\nIn-memory sets and dictionaries\\n\\n●\\n\\nDatabase applications with fewer insertions and deletions but frequent data lookups.\\n\\n●\\n\\nApplications that need enhanced searching.\\n\\n36. What is the difference between the B tree and the B+ tree?\\na) B Tree\\nIt refers to a self-balancing m-way tree, where ‘m’ signifies the tree’s order. It is an extension\\nof the binary search tree where nodes can have more than two children and one key. The\\ndata is sorted in a B tree with lower values placed on the left subtree while higher values are\\nplaced on the right subtree.\\n\\n\\x0cb) B+ Tree\\nIt refers to an advanced self-balanced tree where every path from the root to the leaf is of\\nthe same length. This shows that all the paths occurred at the same level. So, when all leaf\\nnodes appear on the second level, no other lead node can appear on the third level.\\n\\n37. What are the applications for B-trees?\\nBefore discussing the real-life applications of B-tress, let’s have a look at some of its\\nproperties:\\nThe following are the key properties of a B-tree data structure:\\n●\\n\\nAll the leaves are at the same height.\\n\\n●\\n\\nMinimum degree ‘t’ refers to a B-tree, and its value is determined by the disk block\\nsize.\\n\\n●\\n\\nEach node must have at least t-1 keys. The root is the only exception to this, which\\nmust contain at least one key.\\n\\n●\\n\\nIn B-tree, node insertion happens at Leaf Node.\\n\\n●\\n\\nThe number of children of a node= number of keys in the node plus one.\\n\\n●\\n\\nUnlike the binary search tree, which grows and shrinks from downward, B-tree grows\\nand shrinks from the root.\\n\\n●\\n\\nNodes, including root, can’t have more than 2*t-1 keys.\\n\\n●\\n\\nKeys are sorted in ascending order. A child between k1 and k2 consists of all keys\\nranging from k1 to k2.\\n\\nThe applications of B-tree are:\\n●\\n\\nIn CAD systems, to sort and search geometric data.\\n\\n●\\n\\nIn the case of a large database, to access data stored on a disc\\n\\n●\\n\\nMost servers use B-tree\\n\\n●\\n\\nTo achieve multilevel indexing\\n\\n●\\n\\nTo search data in less time\\n\\n●\\n\\nIn areas such as computer networks, natural language processing (NLP), and\\ncryptography.\\n\\nIt is among the top interview questions in data structures.\\n\\n\\x0c38. What is a graph data structure?\\nIt is a non-linear data structure with nodes or vertices connected by a set of ordered edges.\\nThese edges are lines or arcs connecting two nodes in a graph so that data can be\\naccessed and stored based on requirements.\\n\\n39. What are the applications of a graph data structure?\\nReal-time applications of a graph data structure are:\\n●\\n\\nSocial network graphs to track users\\' data.\\n\\n●\\n\\nGoogle Maps for building transportation systems\\n\\n●\\n\\nTransport grids with stations represented as vertices and routes as edges\\n\\n●\\n\\nDijkstra algorithm to determine the smallest path between two or more nodes\\n\\n●\\n\\nUtility graph or water or power with vertices representing connection points and\\nedges of the wires.\\n\\n●\\n\\nOperating System, in the Resource Allocation Graph where each process and\\nresource are represented as vertices\\n\\n●\\n\\nWorld Wide Web, where web pages are considered as vertices\\n\\n●\\n\\nComputer science to represent the flow of computation\\n\\nAdvanced Data Structure Interview Questions\\n40. What is the difference between the Breadth First Search (BFS)\\nand Depth First Search (DFS)?\\n\\nBreadth First Search (BFS)\\n\\nDepth First Search (DFS)\\n\\n\\x0cUses Queue data structure to find the\\n\\nUses the Stack data structure to\\n\\nshortest path.\\n\\nfind the shortest path.\\n\\nNeed to walk through all the nodes\\n\\nBegins at the root node and then\\n\\non the same level to go to the next\\n\\nproceeds\\n\\nlevel in BFS.\\n\\nthrough all the nodes to reach the\\n\\nas\\n\\nfar\\n\\nas\\n\\npossible\\n\\nnode with no unvisited nearby\\nnodes.\\n\\nIt is slower.\\n\\nFaster compared to BFS.\\n\\nPerforms better if the target is closer\\n\\nPerforms better if the target is\\n\\nto the source.\\n\\nfarther from the source.\\n\\nNeeds more memory.\\n\\nNeeds less memory.\\n\\nNo backtracking is possible.\\n\\nAs it is a recursive algorithm, it\\nemploys the backtracking.\\n\\nBased on the FIFO principle (First In\\n\\nBased on the LIFO principle (Last\\n\\nFirst Out).\\n\\nIn First Out).\\n\\n41. How do you find the height of a node in a tree?\\nThe height of a node is equal to the number of edges in the longest path to the leaf from that\\nnode. Here, the depth of a leaf node is zero.\\n\\nI) List the types of trees.\\na) General Tree\\nA generic tree with no constrained hierarchy. Here, nodes can have an endless number of\\noffspring and the rest of the trees are subsets of the tree.\\n\\n\\x0cb) Binary Tree\\nIt is the most commonly-known tree. Here, each parent has a minimum of two offspring,\\nwhich are called the left and right youngsters. When a binary tree has certain features and\\nlimitations, other trees, such as RBT, AVL, and binary search trees, are used.\\nc) Binary Search Tree\\nAlso known as BST, it is an extension of a binary tree with various optional constraints. The\\nleft child value of a node should be less than or equal to the parent value, and the correct\\nchild value should be higher than or equal to the parent value.\\ne) Red and Black Tree\\nIt is an auto-balancing tree with red or black nodes. Hence, the name Red-Black Tree. It\\nkeeps the forest balanced. The tree might not be balanced, but the searching process takes\\nO(log n) time.\\nf) N-ary Tree\\nN represents the maximum number of children. In this tree, every node’s children are either\\n0 or N.\\n\\n42. How does bubble sort work?\\nA bubble sort is a commonly-used sorting method appalled to arrays where adjacent\\nelements are compared to each other. Also, values are exchanged as per the order followed\\nin the arrangement. It is named bubble sort as it involves exchanging elements like bubbles\\nfloating in the water and larger entities sinking to the bottom.\\n\\n43. What is a Jagged array?\\nA jagged array is used to store rows of data elements of varying sizes and dimensions. It\\nenhances efficiency while working with multidimensional arrays.\\n\\n44. How do you find a loop in a linked list?\\nThere are multiple ways to detect a loop in a linked list. One can use the following methods:\\n●\\n\\nHashing\\n\\n●\\n\\nFloyd’s cycle-finding algorithm\\n\\n●\\n\\nVisited nodes method\\n\\n\\x0c45. What are the advantages of a binary search over a linear\\nsearch?\\n●\\n\\nA binary search is comparatively more efficient than a linear search as it involves\\nfewer comparisons.\\n\\n●\\n\\nLinear search allows you to eliminate only one element per comparison each time\\nyou fail to find the value you want. However, a binary search allows you to eliminate\\nhalf the data set with each comparison.\\n\\n●\\n\\nThe binary search runs in O(log n) time while the linear search runs in O(n) time. So,\\nthe more elements in the search array, the faster the binary search is.\\n\\n46. What is a heap data structure?\\nHeap is a unique tree-based non-linear data structure with a complete binary tree. It means\\nthat all the levels are filled except possibly the last one, which consists of all the elements,\\nand all the nodes are left-justified.\\nBroadly, a heap is of two types:\\n●\\n\\nMax-Heap: The value of the root node must be greatest from all other keys of its\\nchildren node. The same is recursively true for all sub-trees in that binary tree.\\n\\n●\\n\\nMin-Heap: The value of the key at the root node must be the smallest among all\\nkeys of the children node. The same stands recursively true for all other sub-trees in\\nthat binary tree.\\n\\n47. Define Red-Black Tree.\\nA red-black tree is a binary tree invented in 1972 by Rudolf Bayer and was dubbed as\\n\"symmetric binary B-tree”. It is a self-balancing binary tree that stores data in two’s\\ncomplementary binary formats.\\nEach node is either red or black, and by comparing these colours on a path from root to leaf,\\nthe tree ensures that the path is not more than twice as long as others, making it balanced. It\\ncan be used to store any kind of data represented as a set of values.\\nAlthough it is similar to a binary tree, there is one difference. The read-black tree is faster to\\naccess, making it suitable for storing a large amount of data.\\n\\n\\x0c48. What is a Trie data structure?\\nTrie stands for ‘Retrieval’ and is also known as the prefix tree or digital tree. It stores a set of\\nstrings in the form of a sorted tree. Let’s say strings range from letters ‘a to z’ of the English\\nalphabet, so each trie node can’t have more than 26 points.\\nAlso, every individual node has the same number of pointers as alphabet characters. This\\ndata structure can check the work in the dictionary by its prefix. Moreover, it allows you to\\nprint all words alphabetically, which is an advantage over hashing. It ensures efficient prefix\\nsearch or auto-complete.\\nThe key to which each node is connected is based on its position in the Trie data structure.\\nYou can add or find strings in O(L) time, where L = Length of a single word. This is a faster\\nway than BST and hashing, considering the way it is implemented. You don’t need to\\ncompute a hash function or manage collisions like in open addressing or separate chaining.\\n\\n49. Explain the Segment Tree data structure.\\nAs the name suggests, a segment tree data structure stores segments or intervals. It is a\\nbinary tree comprising nodes representing intervals. It is used in case there are multiple\\nchanges in array elements or various range queries on an array.\\nIts operations include:\\n●\\n\\nBuilding Tree: To create a data structure and initialise the segment tree variable.\\n\\n●\\n\\nQuerying Tree: To run a range query on an array.\\n\\n●\\n\\nUpdating the Tree: To change the tree by updating the value of an array at a certain\\npoint over an interval.\\n\\nA few real-time applications of segment tree data structure are:\\n●\\n\\nComputation geometry\\n\\n●\\n\\nPattern recognition and image processing\\n\\n●\\n\\nStoring segments randomly\\n\\n●\\n\\nCalculate range max/min, prefix sum/product, range sum/product, etc.\\n\\n●\\n\\nStatic and dynamic RMQ\\n\\n●\\n\\nGeographic information system\\n\\n\\x0cUpskill Yourself With Expert-led Online Training Programs!\\n● Web Development Course\\n● Wordpress Course\\n● Mern Stack Course\\n● Full Stack Developer Course\\n\\n● HTML Course\\n● React Js Course\\n● Javascript Course\\n● PHP Curse\\n● Power BI Course\\n● Tableau Course\\n● Data Science Course\\n● Python Course\\n● Data Analytics Course\\n● Ethical Hacking Course\\n● Penetration Testing Course\\n● Cyber Security Course\\n\\nView All Courses\\n\\nAll Courses Include:\\n● Regular Live Classes\\n● Mentorship by Industry Experts\\n● Dedicated Doubt Sessions\\n● Industry-recognized Certification\\n● Career Support\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c')]\n"
